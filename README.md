chatApp
=======
chatApp is used to pull messages from a parse server, display them in an unordered list, and allow a user to make comments
to a server using Ajax GET and Post requests.
This app is a first project of mine starting from minimal to zero knowledge of javascipt, jquery, css and html coding styles.

Thanks for viewing!
